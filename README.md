# Playback in SwiftUI

This repo is tracking my exploration of audio and video playback experiences in SwiftUI. 

See [DevNotes.md#user-experiences-examples-to-demo](./PlaybackInSwiftUI/Doc/DevNotes.md#user-experiences-examples-to-demo) for the user experiences I will be spiking. 

Points to note: 
- This repo is to explore/spike AV experiences in SwiftUI. The architecture/ code structures and lack thereof are not indicative of production code.
- I'm not a SwiftUI expert. Things like consideration of SwiftUI view lifecycles, correct usage of property wrappers etc is a learning curve for me!  

## Building

- Minimum Deployment Target iOS / iPadOS 15.6
- Xcode 14.1 +
